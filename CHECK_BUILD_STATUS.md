# Build Status Check

The v1.0.0 release tag has been recreated with fixed GitHub Actions workflow.

## What was fixed:
- Updated artifact paths to include `dist/` directory
- Fixed executable paths for all platforms
- Corrected asset upload paths in the release workflow

## Check build progress:
1. Visit: https://github.com/kumar10248/key_replacer/actions
2. Look for the "Build and Release" workflow triggered by the v1.0.0 tag
3. Wait for all three builds (Linux, Windows, macOS) to complete

## Expected timeline:
- **Test phase**: ~5-10 minutes (runs on all Python versions)
- **Build phase**: ~10-15 minutes per platform (3 platforms in parallel)
- **Release phase**: ~2-3 minutes (uploads artifacts)
- **Total**: ~15-25 minutes

## Once complete:
The download links will be available at:
https://github.com/kumar10248/key_replacer/releases/tag/v1.0.0

## Files that will be available:
- `key-replacer-linux` (Linux executable)
- `key-replacer-windows.exe` (Windows executable) 
- `key-replacer-macos` (macOS executable)

## Manual verification:
```bash
# Test the local build
./dist/key-replacer --version
./dist/key-replacer --help
./dist/key-replacer  # Start GUI
```

**Status**: Builds triggered at $(date)
**Next check**: In 20-25 minutes
