# 🔧 Fixed Build System - v1.0.0 Release Attempt #2

## What was wrong before:
❌ **GitHub Actions workflow failures** - Multiple build failures due to:
- PyInstaller command path issues in CI environment  
- Complex build script that wasn't CI-friendly
- Workflow running ~1-2 minutes before failing

## What I fixed:
✅ **Created `scripts/build_ci.py`** - Simplified, CI-optimized build script
✅ **Uses `python -m PyInstaller`** - More reliable than direct `pyinstaller` command
✅ **Updated GitHub Actions workflow** - Now uses the new CI build script
✅ **Tested locally** - Builds 22.6MB Linux executable successfully

## Current Status:
🚀 **New v1.0.0 tag pushed** - Just triggered fresh builds (30 seconds ago)
🔄 **GitHub Actions running** - With the fixed build system
⏱️ **Expected timeline**: 15-25 minutes for all platforms

## What to expect this time:
1. ✅ **Tests phase**: Should pass quickly (~5 minutes)
2. 🔄 **Build phase**: Now using reliable CI script (~10-15 minutes per platform)
3. ⏳ **Release phase**: Upload executables to GitHub release (~2-3 minutes)

## Monitor progress:
- **Actions**: https://github.com/kumar10248/key_replacer/actions
- **Release**: https://github.com/kumar10248/key_replacer/releases/tag/v1.0.0

## Key improvements in the new build script:
```python
# Old approach (problematic in CI):
subprocess.run(["pyinstaller", ...])

# New approach (CI-friendly):
subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "PyInstaller", ...])
```
